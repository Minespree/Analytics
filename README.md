This is the code that powered the GameAnalytics client of the former Minespree Network. We used this project across the network to keep track of diverse metrics used to improve our games and systems. 

Besides the removal of some branding and configuration data, it is more or less unmodified. It is probably not _directly_ useful to third parties in its current state, but it may be help in understanding how the Minespree network operated.

We are quite open to the idea of evolving this into something more generally useful. If you would like to contribute to this effort, talk to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/KUFmKXN).

Please note that this project might have legacy code that was planned to be refactored and as so, we kindly ask you not to judge the programming skills of the author(s) based on this single codebase.

## Requirements

To build Analytics, the following will need to be installed and available from your shell:

* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) version 131 or later (older versions _might_ work)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

You can find detailed installation instructions for these tools on the [Getting started](https://github.com/Minespree/Docs/blob/master/setup/DEPENDENCIES.md) docs page.

## Getting started

Analytics is required by other packages and as so, you will need to install it to your local `.m2` repo by running:

```
mvn install
```

You can also deploy it to your own Maven repo to use the GitLab CI Docker image and make distribution easier. [Instructions](https://github.com/Minespree/Docs/blob/master/deploy/PLAYPEN_DEPLOYER.md)

## Architecture

This repo contains the following components:

* Analytics client that sends data to the [GameAnalytics](https://gameanalytics.com/) API.
* Event class used to standardize the data format.
